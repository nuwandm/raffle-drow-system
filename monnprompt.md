- Frame rate: 30fps
  VISUAL COMPOSITION:
- Large blood-red moon positioned in upper RIGHT area (around 20% from top, 15% from right edge)
- Leave LEFT side space for Jason character overlay (bottom-left quarter should be darker/less busy)
- Keep CENTER area moderately clear for UI overlay panel
  MAIN ELEMENTS:
- Massive crimson blood moon with subtle pulsing glow
- Solar flare beams emanating from moon, flowing diagonally toward bottom-left direction

- Atmospheric fog and mist rolling slowly across scene
- Blood-red color palette: #8b0000, #dc143c, #b91c1c, #7f1d1d
  ANIMATED ELEMENTS:

move the moon left right corner of the video and fix the position( don't move the moon) only change lightness of it and add more bats in the background and add lightning effect to the video
